# Automata-Learning
This framework contains functions as follows:\
FnClusterSegs(): clusters trace segments\
FnEstODE(): estimates ordinary differential equations from the clustered trace segments\
FnLI(): estimates linear inequalities for changepoints in the traces\
FnPTA(): generates state transitions with guard conditions\
FnGenerateHyst(): generates a hybrid automation in Hyst data structure\
FnHyst2State(): converts Hyst data structure to Stateflow data structure

# Run examples
Run main function in each example to generate the "automata_learning.mdl" which will be in the "output_slsf_models" folder
